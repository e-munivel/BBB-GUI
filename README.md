# WebConf Greenlight

Greenlight is a simple front-end interface for your BigBlueButton server. At its heart, Greenlight provides a minimalistic web-based application that allows users to:

  * Signup/Login with Google, Office365, OpenID Connect, or through the application itself.
  * Manage your account settings and user preferences.
  * Create and manage your own personal rooms.
  * Invite others to your room using a simple URL.
  * View recordings and share them with others.

Greenlight is also completely configurable. This means you can turn on/off features to make Greenlight fit your specific use case. 

## Installation on a WebConf Server

Greenlight is designed to work on a [BigBlueButton 2.0](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) (or later) server.
